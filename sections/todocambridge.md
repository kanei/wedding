# Things to do in Cambridge:

We have made a list of things to do in Cambridge for guests who have some time to spare between the wedding ceremony and the evening party.

In general, [Tripadvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attractions-g186225-Activities-Cambridge_Cambridgeshire_England.html) is always great.


If the weather is good, it is always great fun to go punting. We would recommend self punting as the tours are pretty expensive. The main punting company are [Scudamores](http://www.scudamores.com) who are in two locations; on Mill Lane and where Bridge Street meets the river.

There happens to be a [Thai food festival](http://heyevent.uk/event/7c6iinjcs6zo2a/cambridge-thai-festival-event-page) on Parker’s Piece on the 6th, which might be worth a visit.

For those who like museums there are many to choose from in Cambridge. We can recommend the Fitzwilliam and Scott Polar, and check out Tripadvisor for many more.

Of course the weather will be glorious (fingers crossed) so the [Cambridge Botanic Gardens](http://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk/) will be worth a visit.

If anyone is coming for a longer stay, the [Shakespeare festival](http://www.cambridgeshakespeare.com) is definitely worth going to… it will clash with the evening party on the 6th though.

Again, with the glorious weather we WILL have, grabbing an ice cream and/or beer to hang out on one of many of the greens would be lovely. Jesus Green, Christ’s Piece are lovely options. Parkers Piece is closer to Downing, but not as picturesque.  

If you fancy it, wandering around the colleges is a classic touristy thing to do. Some you have to pay to get into, such as King’s College and Trinity College. Clare College and Sidney Sussex are usually free to enter. Follow directions for student entrance at St John’s College and walk in like you belong there. St John’s is definitely worth a visit!
